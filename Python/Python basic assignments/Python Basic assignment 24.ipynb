    "\n",
    "Similar to map(), filter() takes a function object and an iterable and creates a new list. As the name suggests, filter() forms a new list that contains only elements that satisfy a certain condition, i.e. the function we passed returns True.\n",
    "\n",
    "reduce() works differently than map() and filter(). It does not return a new list based on the function and iterable we've passed. Instead, it returns a single value.reduce() works by calling the function we passed for the first two items in the sequence. The result returned by the function is used in another call to function alongside with the next (third in this case), element. This process repeats until we've gone through all the elements in the sequence."

    "\n",
    "Ans.\n",
    "Function annotations are arbitrary python expressions that are associated with various part of functions. These expressions are evaluated at compile time and have no life in python’s runtime environment. Python does not attach any meaning to these annotations. They take life when interpreted by third party libraries.\n",

    "    1. Use 4-space indentation and no tabs.\n",
    "    2.2. Use docstrings : There are both single and multi-line docstrings that can be used in Python. However, the single line comment fits in one line, triple quotes are used in both cases. These are used to define a particular program or define a particular function.\n",
    "    3.Wrap lines so that they don’t exceed 79 characters : The Python standard library is conservative and requires limiting lines to 79 characters. The lines can be wrapped using parenthesis, brackets, and braces. They should be used in preference to backslashes.\n",
    "    4. Use of regular and updated comments are valuable to both the coders and users \n",
    "    5. Use of trailing commas. For eg: Tup = (\"Akshay\",)\n",
    "    6. Use spaces around operators and after commas, but not directly inside bracketing constructs. For eg: a = f(1, 2) + g(3, 4)\n",
    "    7. While naming of function of methods always use self for the first argument to instance methods and cls for the first argument to class methods.    "

    "7. Name three or more ways that functions can communicate results to a caller.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans.\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Here – we see when function is not “return”. For example, we want the square of 4, and it should give answer “16” when the code is executed. Which it gives when we simply use “print x*x” code, but when you call function “print square” it gives “None” as an output. This is because when you call the function, recursion does not happen and fall off the end of the function. Python returns “None” for failing off the end of the function.for eg:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def square(X):\n",
    "        print(X*X)\n",
    "        \n",
    "    print(square(16))\n",
    "Output:\n",
    "    16\n",
    "    None\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "    2. When we use the “return” function and execute the code, it will give the output “16.” For eg:\n",
    "    \n",
    "        def square(X):\n",

    "    3. Functions in Python are themselves an object, and an object has some value. When we run the command “print square” it returns the value of the object. Since we have not passed any argument, we don’t have any specific function to run over here it returns a default value (0x021B2D30) which is the location of the object. for eg:\n",
